## Hi there 👋

### With a foundation in statistics, I have embraced roles in the machine learning and AI realm. Currently as an AI Camera Specialist at Zira, I train custom computer vision models across various industries, including food & beverage, lumber, etc. In this capacity, I actively contribute to quality assurance processes in factory environments by developing solutions for object detection, tracking, and monitoring key metrics. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, I deploy AI cameras with computer vision models for precise and efficient recognition. My role also extends to direct client engagement, where I tailor solutions to their unique needs and create intuitive dashboards that comprehensively present the metrics most relevant to our clients.

### Prior to my current role, I gained valuable experience as a Data Scientist Intern at Frenn, contributing to a pilot project for a software company. In that capacity, I utilized NLP packages and transformers for NLP model development, showcasing adaptability by swiftly acquiring new skills.

### Complementing my practical experience, I am pursuing a part-time Master’s Degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech, with a specialization in Computational Data Analytics. My educational foundation is rooted in a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science from UC Santa Barbara. 

### I am open to connecting with professionals in the fields of AI, computer vision, and data science, my focus is on knowledge exchange, networking, and collaboration for transformative projects.
